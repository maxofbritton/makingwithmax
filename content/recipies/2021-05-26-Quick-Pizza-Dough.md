# Quick Pizza Dough

## Ingredients

- 525g cold water

- 7g fresh yeast

- 80g sourdough starter

- 700g KA bread flour (12+% protein), Alternatively, subsititue 150g with artisanal flour.

- 14g kosher or sea salt


## Methodology

1. In a stand mixer bowl, add the cold water, yeast, and sourdough starter (Starter is optional - mostly for flavor). Crumble fresh yeast and distribute that and starter in water. Let sit for 5 minutes.

2. Add the flour and salt. Mix in mixer (on 2nd speed) with dough hook for one minute.

3. Scrape down sides of bowl to incorporate bits and mix for another 14 minutes.

4. Dump dough into smooth sided container (with lid) that has been slicked with olive oil and a little water (suggest a Dutch oven).

5. Fold the dough (wet your hands as needed) and wait 15 minutes.

6. Fold the dough, 15 minutes.

7. Fold the dough, 15 minutes.

8. Fold the dough. Cover with lid and leave in a cool place for an hour or two.

9. Take out, divide dough into 260(ish)g lumps and ball. Should get 5 balls.

10. Put in a covered container and let rise for a couple hours until doubled.

11. Gently stretch on a floured surface. Make pizza. Va bene!

Alternatively, just let dough bulk rise for a couple hours, turn it out onto oiled sheet pan, gently fold once, cover with another overturned sheet pan, let rise for another hour, stretch dough to edges of sheet pan, and make Sicilian pizza.
